As he had expected, Mrs Dursley looked shocked and angry.
After all, they normally pretended she didn't have a sister.
'No,' she said sharply. 'Why?'
'Funny stuff on the news,' Mr Dursley mumbled. 'Owls ...
shooting stars ... and there were a lot of funny-looking people in
town today ...'
'So?' snapped Mrs Dursley.
'Well, I just thought ... maybe ... it was something to do with ...
you know ... her lot.'
Mrs Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr Dursley
wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard the name 'Potter'.
He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, as casually as he could,
'Their son â€“ he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?'
'I suppose so,' said Mrs Dursley stiffly.
'What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?'
'Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.'
'Oh, yes,' said Mr Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. 'Yes, I
quite agree.'
